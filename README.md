# Integrating fire behavior modeling with archeological material science to evaluate fire risk to cultural resources

Cultural resources are artifacts, sites, structures, landscapes, and objects of importance connected to the physical presence, practices, and/or spirituality of past and present peoples1,2. These are managed under multiple local, state, tribal, and federal laws and regulations (e.g., NEPA, NHPA) and can be highly vulnerable to impacts from wildfires. Increasing demand for knowledge about how fire impacts archaeological materials has led to several laboratory and field-based studies on the effects of wildfire (i.e. heat, duration of exposure, etc.) on specific artifacts and materials (ceramics, stone tools, rock art, historic wooden structures, etc.)2. However, connecting these adverse effects to fuel conditions, fire behavior, and protection measures has not been evaluated. Protecting cultural resources during wildfire incidents is often left to post hoc decision-making as resource advisors are not equipped with the necessary analytical tools to accomplish in-depth pre-planning. We propose the development of an analytical tool kit tailored to assist cultural resource managers in 1) evaluating fuel conditions that may contribute to fire behavior that is damaging to cultural resources; 2) determining the most appropriate mitigation/treatment strategies to reduce risk of adverse effects in both pre-fire planning and during a wildfire incident; and 3) assessing pre- and post-fire archeological site conditions using standardized and comparable strategies that consider immediate and long-term fire effects and burn severity. 
  
This project uses a novel, new approach to assessing risk to cultural resources by incorporating recent developments fire behavior modeling to estimate archaeological site-level fuel conditions, fire energy release, and fuel consumption that can lead to adverse effects on archaeological materials. The majority of this work will rely on ongoing fire behavior modeling (QUIC-fire)3 and 3D fuels characterization4â€“6 conducted at the USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station in Athens, GA. Using the arrangement of actual fuels within archaeological sites as inputs for QUIC-fire will allow us to run multiple parameter configurations to simulate multiple fire behaviors and combustion conditions, ranging from low-intensity prescribed fire to extreme, crown fire conditions. From these simulations, we will be able to identify fuel conditions and fire behavior that could result in damage to archaeological material integrity, interpretive value, and cultural significance.
